Changes:

0. Deleted unused code and made spacing more consistent
1. I combined SSN_classes_phases and SSN_classes_ax_only and now call it SSN_classes
2. made a minimalistic folder with only the files that are needed for network_example and I am planning to extend it by
- adding input to the network and plotting inp, output and features such as weights
- adding training

Questions from Clara:

1.
	What is this for in SSN_classes
	#conn_pars = locals()
	#conn_pars.pop("self")
	#self.conn_pars = conn_pars

2. Euler2fixedpt_fullTmax in SSN_classes is newer - can be moved to util. Can we move Euler2fixedpt_fullTmax from SSN_classes to util and can we get rid of the Euler2fixedpt_fullTmax that is in util at the moment?
	
3. We do not use findRmax anymore: in script_two_stage_lateral "from analysis import findRmax" did not work - analysis does not have findRmax
